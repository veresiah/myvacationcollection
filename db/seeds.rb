The Seneca Niagara Resort & Casino is your destination for a luxurious stay if you choose to stay on the American side of the falls. The best attractions offered were the Maid of the Mist boat ride, adventure theater, the cave of the winds, and the various hiking trials. Pro tip: if you would like the full experience without breaking the bank, purchase the Discovery Pass.")

Nova Scotia is a beautiful combination of the city life and the calmness of a small town. There are endless lighthouses, beaches and parks to occupy your leisure. A variety of attractions include historic locations such as Peggy's Cove and UNESCO sites including Joggins Fossil Cliffs, Old Town Lunenburg and Cliffs of Fundy (Bay of Fundy). The best part of my trip to Nova Scotia was the rich history apparent from the architecture and museums in Halifax. This is the perfect destination for a group of laid back seafood lovers!")
Collection.create(destination: "Quebec City, Quebec, Canada", start_date: "12/01/19", end_date: "12/09/19", trip_summary: "Quebec City is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the only walled city in North America! I visited Quebec City (QC) while I was vacationing in Montreal. QC offered a rich history of the French especially during the French and Indian wars in where you can see remnants when visiting the Battlefields Park. One particular feature of this colonial city is its European architecture against its immaculately cleaned streets. My favorite place was Old Quebec where I saw beautiful stone houses build on all elevations and decorated with lovely flowers and hanging baskets. Having a lunch or dinner with your special someone in Old Quebec overlooking the Saint Laurence river is romance at its best here! Château Frontenac is a world famous luxury hotel that stands out in QC's skyline. This structure can be seen from four miles away and sits at the top of a hill in  all its glory.  Citadel de Québec, Basilica Cathedral Notre-Dame de Québec and Place Royale are other must seen destinations when visiting QC.
